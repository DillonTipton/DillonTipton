## Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹
This is my first time creating a GitHub repository.
I am a Computer Engineering student at the University of Dayton. I am excited to learn more about the Go programming language this semester, which is my favorite programming language thus far. I enjoy playing video games in my free time as well as startegy games with my family when the opportunity arises.
